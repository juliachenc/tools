# 1 Advisor in 401K

- A plan sponsor may hire a 401(k) advisor to develop the plan and provide advice on compliance issues, and even help select other third party providers, like a recordkeeper or custodian. The plan sponsor may also hire an investment manager to select and monitor the plan’s mutual fund investments.

## 1.1 Five roles:

1. Consultant - An advisor, however, can consult with you on plan design or the implications of an employee match or vesting schedule.
2. Manager - The adviser who coordinate with your accounting team, board of directors, lawyers and trustees. A good 401(k) advisor will communicate and coordinate with all parties to keep the plan running smoothly.  (**who recommend recordkeeper ?? **)
3. Investment manager 
   1. a 3(21) fiduciary - an advisor who acts as a limited scope fiduciary. This advisor provide investment advice and suggest appropriate investments for the plan, but you still have the final call on the investments and retain the associated fiduciary responsibility
   2. a 3(38) investment manager - who not only makes the final call on investment selection, but also has discretion to change the plan’s mutual fund offerings. (monitors the investments, takes on the liability associated with these duties)
4. Finance professor - an employee educator, help the participants understand the plan itself, along with the investment options offered in the plan. 
5. Administrator&compliance expert - 3(16) fiduciary, handling important aspects of the plan, including reviewing discrimination testing, Form 5500 and so on

## 1.2 Fiduciary vs Broker

**fiduciary duty**: A *fiduciary duty* is a commitment to act in the best interests of another person or entity. When someone has a fiduciary duty to someone else, the person with the duty must act in a way that will benefit someone else, usually financially. The person who has a fiduciary duty is called the **fiduciary**, and the person to whom the duty is owed is called the principal or the beneficiary.

**Fiduciary**: 

- Series 65 License - a license that allows a person to legally act as an investment advisor representative (**RIA**)
- **Fee-only**, do not accept commissions. Their fees are charged for advice and investment management — they don’t receive fees from investment products and securities they sell
- 3(38) fiduciary  - responsible for selecting, managing, monitoring, and benchmarking the investment offerings of the plan. a 3(38) also has discretionary authority to direct the investment of *funds
- 3(21) fiduciary - officially make investment recommendations on the plan, but the plan sponsor are still holding the fiduciary responsibility on the 401(k) plan investment selections



**broker**: A broker is a person or firm who arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller for a commission when the deal is executed

- Series 7 License - a securities license and is typically held by stockbrokers as it gives them a license to trade/sell securities and receive fees for the sale (**broker dealer**)
- Fee-based. Being “fee-based” opens the door for them to accept commissions on funds they put into your plan
- No ERISA fiduciary standard met



**About insurance license**. Insurance products can have giant commissions embedded into them and hold significant conflicts of interest. If an advisor have insurance license, it is possible this advisor will prefer commissions



## 1.3 Advisor additional notes

- Financial advisors could be a firm or an individual
- Financial advisors could sell all kinds of plans, not just retirement plan. Only a few could be very familiar with retirement plan
- Some record keepers have their own financial advisors. These advisors could also sell the plan to other companies

### 1.3.1 Brokerage firm or advisor(BD)

- Wirehouse: 4 largest wealth management firm with lots of financial advisors

- Banks, financial institutions.

- Regional broker dealers: broker dealer firms whose financial advisors operate as independent contractors (as opposed to Wirehouse advisors who are employees of their firms)

- Independent broker dealers: same as regional broker dealers

- Most broker-dealers, meanwhile, are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA),Lots of business in broker dealer is commission based. Record keeper gives the advisor a commission fee to sell a product. Individuals who are brokerage representatives are commission-based planners and typically receive compensation when they sell a certain product or service to a client. These products could include bonds, insurance products, mutual funds, stocks, or a variety of other securities. If the representative works for a BD, the products are often those marketed by the BD or partners of the BD. Individuals working under this model must disclose any relationships and payments received to clients. However, it can be unclear whether they are working in their own best interest or the client’s.

- Other type: fee based. The advisor will charge a fixed percentage of fee on the total assets as the manage fee.

### 1.3.2 Registered investment advisors (RIA)

- RIAs are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or their state securities regulator, depending on their size

- Independent and largely fee-only advisors whose primary means of accessing mutual funds is via supermarket platforms such as Schwab, Fidelity, etc

- RIA tends to operate differently than broker channel, since they have more independency on how they operate. For example, people work in brokerage channel, who they sell to is highly influenced by the firm. 

- They must put their clients’ best interests first. RIAs are often compensated on a fee-only structure, but they may also operate on a fee-based structure. Advisors who work on a fee-only model receive compensation based on a certain percentage of assets under management (AUM). For example, if an advisor charged a 1% annual fee and a client had 1,000,000 AUM, the annual fee would total 10,000 regardless of what products and services were sold to the client. In this model, advisors can still receive commission for the sale of certain types of investments but also charge an asset-based fee for their services.

# 2 Record Keeper

## Insurance Company vs Trust companies

To protect participant assets and enable them to be invested, plan sponsors must hire a provider that can recordkeep the plan and also hold the plan’s assets and provide access to investments. The two types of entities through which recordkeepers do this are generally insurance companies and trust companies.

### Group Annuity

insurance companies issue group annuity contracts to the trustees of the plan, with the trust being the legal entity. 

Group annuity contracts use the term trustee to refer to the individual or individuals who have the highest level of authority—fiduciary authority—to direct the insurance company regarding all matters related to the group annuity contract and the plan, such as investment lineup selection. 

### Truest Companies

401(k) plan sponsors choose recordkeepers that make investments available through a trust company

## 2.1 what does Record keeper do?

- Manage and account for employee investments 
- Make all buys and sells of the mutual funds
- Record the origins or sources of the contributions*
- Recordkeepers keep track of your money. They know how much you’ve invested, what you’ve earned on investments, and so on. Investment managers don’t know who you are; they just manage a large pool of money.
- Recordkeepers charge a fee to cover their costs. Employers may agree to pay for recordkeeping, or they may decide to pass the costs on to employees. When employers choose to pay for recordkeeping, it is generally because they:
- Want to keep investment costs inside the plan as low as possible for employees (including a business owner/employee)
- May qualify for a tax benefit if paying for the retirement plan is a deductible expense
- When employers pay for recordkeeping, they typically write a check annually or quarterly.
- When employees pay for recordkeeping, the fee may be paid as either a flat fee or an asset based fee. With flat fees, employees see a fee deducted from their account periodically (monthly or quarterly, for example). The dollar amount generally does not change, so it’s a predictable, recurring cost.

## 2.2 What does Record Keeper not do?

- Give investment advice
- Help with plan design
- Prepare or sign the Form 5500
- Manage government compliance 
- Partner with you to meet your goals with the plan

## 2.3 Record Keeping - Insurance companies vs mutual fund companies

if an employer wanted to set up a plan with more than one mutual fund family, an insurance company was the only real option. As a result, insurance companies came to dominate the industry

## 2.4 Filling Form 5500

- Many plan record keepers specify in their contracts they will only perform certain ministerial functions with respect to the administration of qualified retirement plans, such as simply *preparing* the Form 5500.  Ministerial functions are not fiduciary duties.

- So while your client’s record keeper may be filling out Form 5500 for the plan, the plan administrator — who is often the plan sponsor — remains the party responsible for ensuring the information is accurate and timely filed.

# 3 Plan Sponsors

- People who decide what benefit are provided to the employee

- Plan sponsor could be an individual (owner of a small company) or a group (finance department of a large company)

# 4 Plan Participants

- People who work for the company as employee

## Total Participants vs Active Participants

Total Participants:

- An active employee who has chosen not to participate, but is eligible to participate in the benefit plan.

- Retired eligible employees that have a balance in the 401k benefits account on the first day of the plan year.

- Employees who have been terminated or quite their job, but have a balance in there 401k benefit plan on the first day of the plan year.

- Beneficiaries who are receiving or are entitled to receive 401k benefits of a deceased participant of the plan.

Active Participants:

- anyone who is eligible, and participates in the benefit plan

Example:

- you may employee 150 people and only 125 participate in the 401k benefit plan. The other 25 employees are considered “eligible” but are not participating in the benefit plan. Therefore, your company would be a considered a “large plan” because you have 150 “eligible” participants.

## Participants with Account balance

- Recordkeeping and other plan-related fees are often based on the number of participants with account balances.

# 5 Plan

- Retirement planning refers to financial strategies of saving, investments, and ultimately distributing money meant to sustain oneself during retirement.

## 5.1 Plan Administrator

- A plan administrator is a person or company responsible for managing a retirement fund or a pension plan on behalf of its participants and beneficiaries. 
- It could be the plan sponsor, it could also be the advisor (Administrator&compliance expert)
- The plan administrator manages the day-to-day operations of a retirement fund or pension plan.
- **The administrator does not make investing decisions**, but may ensure that money contributed to it is being invested correctly in accordance with its stated goals

### Single vs Multi(Taft-Hartley) vs Multipler employer plan

- A single employer plan is  a retirement savings plan maintained by one unrelated employers

- A multiple employer plan, as covered here, is a retirement savings plan maintained by two or more unrelated employers

- A multiemployer plan(Taft-Hartley plan) is a **collectively bargained plan** between more than one employer, typically within the same or related industries, and a labor union

#### Collectively bargained plan

   any plan is sponsored by the Employer pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in effect between the Employer and any union, local or lodge of any union or any bargaining agent for any union which such union, local, lodge or bargaining agent and the Employer have provided that some or all of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be covered by such plan.

### Benefit Offset

Benefit offset is a reduction in the amount of benefit payments received by a participant in a retirement plan that may result when the participant owes money to the plan. (the overdue contributions the participant should have paid in the past)

- When a participant owes money to a retirement plan, there might be a reduction in the payment referred to as a benefit offset.
- This offset can occur when receiving benefits from other sources.
- The U.S. Social Security Act allows up to 10% of the benefits to be held for funds owed

### 404 C

- a defined contribution plan must offer a broad range of investment options and make it possible for participants to easily view and control their investments

### Participant-Directed Vs Pooled Plans

- Pooled plans have a single trust account managed by the plan sponsor (the trustee). All plan contributions are co-mingled and are tracked by the TPA. A discount brokerage such as Ameritrade or Vanguard is typically used as a custodian. Plan participants do not get to manage their accounts and have no say in the investment direction of the plan investments. The investments in a pooled account can be managed by an investment manager
- every plan participant gets their own account and is responsible for managing their own investments. [In participant-directed plans, the plan sponsor is ultimately liable for plan performance, as well as for investment selection and participant education Participant-directed plans require the services of a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a custodian and an investment adviser
- key take away:
  - Participant-directed plan, participant gets their own account is responsible for managing their own investments (usually combined with 404c feature)
  - Participant could also have partial ability to direct their own investment
  - Pooled plans a single trust account managed by the plan sponsor

### QDIA (Qualified Default Investment Alternative)

- When money is contributed to an employee's retirement account and the employee hasn’t made an investment election, that money can then be automatically invested into the QDIA as a default. In doing so, a QDIA can provide the potential for long-term growth.

### Amend Return

### Form 5558

Form 5558 is an application used by employers to request more time to file certain employee plan returns

### Automatic Extension

- The plan year and the employer’s tax year are the same
- The employer has been granted an extension of time to file its federal income tax return to a date later than the normal due date for filing the Form 5500
- A copy of the application for extension of time to file the federal income tax return is maintained with the filer’s records

### DFVC - Delinquent Filer  Voluntary Correction Program

(EBSA) is providing plan administrators with the opportunity to pay reduced civil  penalties for voluntarily complying with the annual reporting requirements.

### Blackout Period

- This assets is relative to recordkeeper. 
- A sponsor can choose a recordkeeper that has proprietary funds on its investment platform or it can choose one that does not
- A proprietary investment is one that has the same name attached to it as that of the record keeper/TPA
- This is extremely common with insurance company providers as well as with the handful of mutual fund companies who are still in the record keeping business
- Key take away: **A proprietary fund is a mutual fund that is owned and managed by your record keeper**, benefits for record keeper including commissions and higher fees
- **Some retirement plan record keepers resort to aggressive sales tactics with their proprietary products, offering discounted record-keeping services if proprietary funds are used**

### Index Funds vs Managed funds

- Index funds are low-cost mutual funds designed to track the performance of groups of stocks
  - **don’t have any active management**
- managed funds have an active manager who, on a daily basis, is deciding which investments to buy and sell

### Money Market Funds

- A money market fund is a kind of mutual fund that invests in highly liquid, near-term instruments. These instruments include cash, cash equivalent securities, and high-credit-rating, debt-based securities with a short-term maturity (such as U.S. Treasuries)

### Stable Value Funds

- These funds, which are typically offered in 401(k) plans, are somewhat similar to money market funds, except they post higher yields with relatively little risk.
- stable value funds are a type of cash fund that resembles a money market fund by offering protection of principal while paying stable rates of interest. Like their money market cousins, these funds maintain a constant share price of $1.

### Annuity

- Annuities are financial products that offer a guaranteed income stream, usually for retirees.

- For employee, mandatory plan participation could make people uncomfortable

## 408(k) plan (SEP)

- A 408(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan akin to 401(k)
- aka: **SEP** - simplified employee pension
- The 408(k) plan is available to companies with 25 or fewer employees and self-employed individuals who are subject to the same contribution limits as employers.
